We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with
missing quotes. Always quote template expression brackets when they
start a value. For instance:

    with_items:
      - {{ foo }}

Should be written as:

    with_items:
      - "{{ foo }}"

ip-172-31-62-102.ec2.internal should use /usr/bin/python3, but is using

ip-172-31-62-102.ec2.internal should use /usr/bin/python3, but is using 
/usr/bin/python for backward compatibility with prior Ansible releases. A 
future Ansible release will default to using the discovered platform python for
 this host. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/reference_appendices/inter
preter_discovery.html for more information. This feature will be removed in 
version 2.12. Deprecation warnings can be disabled by setting

ip-172-31-62-102.ec2.internal should use /usr/bin/python3, but is using
